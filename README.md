**In this [article](https://github.com/wangjing0/Entropy-is-all-she-cares/blob/main/entropy2021.pdf), we looked into the EEG signal from the perspective of a dynamical system. We argue that normal and abnormal brain activities can be 
* visualized in the phase space to the best interest of experimenters. 
* manifested in the changes of dynamics, and most importantly. 
* captured by an intrinsic measure, namely entropy, of the system.
